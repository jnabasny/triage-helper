# Triage Helper

Triage Helper is a tool to assist with sorting and assigning support tickets in high-volume help desk environments. It determines who is available to work tickets, lists each agent's expertise, links available agents' names to their current tickets, and automates removing names of agents that are out of the office.

## Features

This tool currently supports:

* List available agents by the hour
* Display agent's expertise
* Highlight agents who are on planned leave or out unexpectedly
* Automatically refresh page every 5 minutes

## Roadmap

To be added in the future:

* Integrate with Freshdesk API (list open tickets, CSAT, etc.)
* Integrate time off with SharePoint calendars
* Better database management
